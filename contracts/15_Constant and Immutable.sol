/*---------------------------------------------------------NOTE---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is more over like a gas optimization technique rather than just explaning the basics 

State variables could be specified as immutable or constant.
In solidity, we use constant to permanently fix a variable value so that afterward, it canâ€™t be altered.
A constant variable is assigned a value at the time of declaration. On the other hand,
immutable is also used for the same purpose but is a little flexible as it can be assigned inside a constructor at the time of its construction.

Note: Both immutable and constant variables can't be changed once declared.
